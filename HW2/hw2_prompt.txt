You will have to perform the following tasks:
1. Load the dataset.
2. Perform k-means clustering. Determine the optimal number of clusters, for e.g. using elbow method. 
3. Perform clustering with different methods as implemented in scikit-learn. 
4. Now, try clustering with another distance metric (e.g. Cosine, Jaccard, etc.). 
Hint: Think whether the default distance metric is appropriate for your dataset or not.
5. Visualize results using the dimensionality reduction (UMAP or tSNE) techniques with respect to the cluster labels. 
6. Compare clustering results. Try to rationalize observed commonalities or differences with respect to clustering methods and distance metrics used.

 

NOTE: Please submit your work only on this course's Gradescope as a single zipped file containing the python script(s) (.ipynb or .py) + your write-up/discussion (add as pdf or text cell(s) in notebook). Rename the file as HW2_FirstNameLastName.zip before submission. This is crucial for TAs as it helps them save time by avoiding the need to navigate through multiple file submissions from a single student while grading.
